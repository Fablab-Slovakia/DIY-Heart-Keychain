# DIY-Heart-Keychain

Check it out on [SasaKaranovic.com/projects/diy-heart-keychain][1]

This one is a very simple but cool project, something that I would recommend to anyone who is interested into DIY electronics, gadgets and learning new stuff in general. 

It is definitely one of those projects that donâ€™t require too much time but you can learn a lot by making it and also earn a lot of credit by sharing it with your friends and family.
